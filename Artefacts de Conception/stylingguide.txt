Style guideline

We want to keep the website simple and easy to use so we will be using basic colors like grey white and black. We kept the color selection neutral and we avoided bright colors. We wanted to make the page look comfortable for the consumer and professional for a restaurant business owner.
Color choice:
Bouton nav. bar ? #F4F4F4
Bouton nav. bar hover ? #000000
Background nav. bar ? #999797
login button and sign in ? #E34030
login button and sign in hover ? #F4F4F4
Login Hyperlink and sign in? Bleu

Style:

Kept the buttons as just text to give it a simple look.
For the login and sign in page we rounded the corner to make it look better.
We have used Montserrat google font because it is readable on the website and eventually on the designed delivery bags.
The logo is clean, flat and expressive since it consists of a drone, a map pin. This describes our company’s services.
For the background image-choice:We are going to try to add two images with the skewed effect which we are still learning how to implement. The first image is going to be a drone wallpaper with warm background and the second background image is going to be that of food.
